# flocking

This repository contains a Python implementation of a flocking controller for a swarm of robots that has range and bearing access to its neighboring robots.

The code was adapted from the example found [here](https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3-examples/blob/master/controllers/footbot_flocking/footbot_flocking.cpp).
